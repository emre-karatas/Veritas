## Project Synopsis

Welcome to CS315-Veritas, an innovative endeavor into the realm of Boolean type programming languages. A close cousin of the imperative languages, our creation diverges in its very essence. Here, variables are restricted to Boolean values, introducing a minimalist, yet profound, dimension to coding.

Accommodating string constants within output operations, our language retains flexibility while being rooted in the Boolean domain. The inaugural phase of this project will be centered around language design, followed by the execution of its lexical analyzer.

## Project Evaluation

**Project 1:** Stellar Performance | Score: 90/100  
**Project 2:** Near Perfection | Score: 98/100  

Venture with us into the captivating world of CS315-Veritas as we explore the nuances of Boolean-based programming, simplifying complex constructs while unraveling the truths that lie within the binary of 0s and 1s.
